                                    The definition of product design describes the process of imagining, creating, and
                                    iterating products that solve users' problems or address specific needs in a given
                                    market.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The key to successful product design is understanding the end-user customer, the
                                    person for whom the product is being created. Product designers attempt to solve
                                    real problems for real people by using empathy and knowledge of their prospective
                                    customers' habits, behaviors, frustrations, needs, and wants.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Good product design practices thread themselves throughout the entire product
                                    lifecycle. Product design is essential in creating the initial user experience and
                                    product offering, from pre-ideation user research to concept development to
                                    prototyping and usability testing.

                                    Industrial designers typically focus on the physical appearance, functionality, and
                                    manufacturability of a product, though they are often involved in far more during a
                                    development cycle. All of this ultimately extends to the overall lasting value and
                                    experience a product or service provides for end-users.

                                    or public setting is the result of a design process. During this process, myriad
                                    decisions are made by an industrial designer (and their team) that are aimed at
                                    improving your life through well-executed design.

                                    Mechanical design is - to design parts, components, products, or systems of
                                    mechanical nature. For example, designs of various machine elements such as shafts,
                                    bearings, clutches, gears, and fasteners fall into the scope of mechanical design.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Numerous criteria have been proposed in mechanical design processes, some primary
                                    design criteria include functions, safety, reliability, manufacturability, weight,
                                    size, wear, maintenance, and liability. In general, a mechanical design problem
                                    should be formulated with clear and complete statements of functions,
                                    specifications, and evaluation criteria.

                                    Machine design is an area of study in which one learns to design machine parts by
                                    utilizing its whole knowledge and experience in field of mechanical engineering.

                                    OBJECTIVES OF DESIGN
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>DESIGN FOR STRENGTH- safety is first so part to be designed should strong enough
                                        to withstand forces in its service. It also required to be resist some probable
                                        happening during service due to increased load by some reason.</li>
                                    <li>DESIGN FOR FUNCTION- every part in a machine has its own function for which it
                                        is applied in machine. designer should ensure that the part to be designed
                                        should fulfill its function satisfactory.</li>
                                    <li>DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING PROCESS- Designer have to modify its product in the
                                        light of available manufacturing processes and their limitations and strengths.
                                        Design of machined part is generally different from that of casting etc.</li>
                                    <li>DESIGN FOR SAFETY- designer should ensure that the part he is designing should
                                        safe in use. And any life or health hazard will not produce from its working.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>DESIGN FOR LOOK AND COMFORT- It is a secondary priority of designer to make a
                                        part with high level of comfort for user and also looks good.</li>

                                    A prototype is basically a demonstration of your device (in this course, the
                                    prototype may also be the final device). It is the fully operational version of the
                                    engineering solution, although it can be made with different materials (which are
                                    cheaper and easier to work with) than the final version.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Prototypes allow you to test how your solution will work - and you can show the
                                    solution to others for feedback.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A prototype is a tangible and precise representation of your product. Now's the time
                                    for real-life testing in the environment in which the actual product will find
                                    itself. The prototype is also to ensure everyone's buy-in within the business, from
                                    the head of design to board members.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once interested parties have had the opportunity to see, touch and experience
                                    exactly what you're proposing to create, they can feed back on functionality,
                                    commercial viability, and potential problems for both manufacturers and end users.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For instance, if you're designing a rack mount cabinet, end users will want to
                                    examine the hinges for durability, the material for sturdiness, and the lock for
                                    security.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And you won't always make the right choices first time. The prototyping stage of
                                    your project is your opportunity to get things wrong without investing too much time
                                    or money — and to fix problems before they have potentially expensive consequences.
                                </p>
